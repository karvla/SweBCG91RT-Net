# SweBCG91RT-Net
This is the project for my ms thesis. The goal is to find new biomarkers for local recurrence in cases of triple-negative breast cancer. A possible biomarker is the spatial distribution of lymphocytes. To investigate this I'm using a U-Net trained on public datasets to segment and classify cells on whole-slide images of breast cancer from the SweBCG91RT study.
